This project is a React frontend created with Vite. The goal is to replicate the design, styling, and animations of https://preview--attend-face-presence-system.lovable.app/ as closely as possible. Prioritize pixel-perfect UI, matching animations, and responsive design. Use modern React best practices and CSS (or CSS-in-JS if needed).
